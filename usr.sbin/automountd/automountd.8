.Sh NAME
.Nm automountd
.Nd daemon handling autofs mount requests
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl D name=value
.Op Fl m maxproc
.Op Fl d
.Op Fl v
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
daemon is responsible for handling autofs(4) mount requests, parsing maps,
and mounting appropriate filesystems.
Upon startup the
.Nm
daemon forks into background and waits for kernel requests.
When a request is received,
.Nm
forks a child process, which then parses appropriate map, mounts filesystems
accordingly, and signals the kernel to release blocked processes that were
waiting for mount.
.Bl -tag -width ".Fl v"
.It Fl D
Define a variable.
.It Fl m
Set limit for the number of forked automountd processes, and thus the number
of mount requests being handled in parallel.
The default is 30.
.It Fl d
Debug mode - increase verbosity and do not daemonize.
.It Fl v
Increase verbosity.
