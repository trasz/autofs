Things to do before it's ready, in no particular order:

- rewrite config parser to be able to specify command line parameters to execs; this would allow to get rid of shell scripts
- man pages for hsm(1), hsmd(8), hsmq(8), hsmfs(5), and hsm.conf(5)
- example configuration for rsync, as cachefs and sshfs
- make it work with Dropbox (net/dropbox-api-command?)
- example configuration for Dropbox
- is there a working filesystem-on-a-blockchain we could interface to?  Or at least p2p?
- fix handling of failed requests - don't create leftover unmanaged files and directories
- add async ioctls, so that eg hsm(1) can trigger staging multiple files at once
- make triggers work on non-directories
- implement release
- implement archive
- implement recycle
- get rid of release trigger in hsmd, it doesn't serve any purpose
- add HSM-related primaries to find(1)
- add "don't descend into offline dirs" option for du(1)
- rethink the terminology - how about s/stage/download/g and s/archive/upload/g?
- hsm(1) should report different states for files that are being staged or archived
- interface to Coda servers somehow?
- use cpdup instead of rsync
